#### Abstract:

One-off sequential pattern mining (SPM) (or SPM under the one-off condition) is a kind of repetitive SPM with gap constraints in which any two occurrences cannot share any letter in the sequence, and has been widely applied in many fields. However, current research has mainly focused on mining frequent patterns, and has only considered the number of patterns in a se- quence, resulting in some low-frequency but extremely important patterns being ignored. A further challenging problem is how to set suitable gap constraints without prior knowledge. To solve these issues, this paper proposes an approach called self-adaptive High-Average utility One-off sequential Pattern (HAOP) mining, and describes an effective algorithm called HAOP- Miner that involves two key steps: support calculation and candidate pattern reduction. For the support calculation, we propose an online Reverse filling (Rf) strategy that can effectively cal- culate the support. Since HAOP mining does not satisfy the Apriori property, a support lower bound method is proposed to accomplish pruning of candidate patterns. The experimental results demonstrate that HAOP-Miner is a high-efficiency approach that makes it easier to mine valuable patterns.
